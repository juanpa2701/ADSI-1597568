3. I'm at the door looking at the girls, I feel like an ice cream, I go to the ice cream shop to buy one.

I'm looking for my money to buy ice cream.

Leave my house.

I'm going to the ice cream shop.

I buy my ice cream.

I pay for my ice cream.

I go to my house while I enjoy my ice cream.

I arrive at my house to finish my ice cream.
